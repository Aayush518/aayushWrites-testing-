What if I was never born, for instance? What if humans were like the monkeys, and they led lives similar to ours while we led lives similar to theirs? I wondered what would happen if dinosaurs made a comeback to Earth as I went through these creative, lol, not brilliant, but humorous and irrational thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The word &#8220;return&#8221; seems irrational; therefore, I altered the sentence to &#8220;had never departed,&#8221; that is, let&#8217;s imagine some dinosaur breeds were still alive on Earth somewhere away, hiding from humanity in a spot that is yet untraced. Let&#8217;s make the assumptions that are likely to occur based on the articles, books, movies, and studies since we weren&#8217;t present to observe what kind of weather and habitat the dinosaurs used to live in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no locations that cannot support the survival of dinosaurs after considering all of these sources. Dinosaurs came in many different breeds. They were present practically everywhere during the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods; some species could survive in hot desert plains, while others could survive in mountains, swamps, forests, coastal islands, and a variety of other habitats. Since they would have been present practically everywhere on Earth if they were still here with us, it makes sense that our belief that they &#8220;had never left&#8221; is incorrect.It becomes sense to suppose that if these creatures, which were deadly predators with exceptional hunting intelligence, were still alive today, humanity would not have evolved. That vicious predatory race would have taken control of the entire world, and we would have been nothing more than their meals. The number of humans is growing by such a vast proportion every day, comparable to how many dinosaurs would have multiplied.&nbsp;All other species would have been wiped out and starved to death by carnivorous dinosaurs.Some of them would have evolved into herbivores and ceased consuming flesh after going for long stretches without food, while others would have consumed other dinosaurs.If dinosaurs started devouring dinosaurs, what type of cannibalism would our great Earth have witnessed? We may expect the civil war among the dinosaurs to get worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in this day and age, where people fight and kill one another, show prejudice toward one another, and regrettably advocate cannibalism, we must infer that dinosaurs have never departed the Earth and have instead regenerated as humans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s go back to business. Assume a miraculous and unexpected event occurs, and dinosaurs appear out of nowhere. See, there are two possibilities here: what if the number of dinosaurs that have come is small or enormous? If the number is enormous, we humans will be powerless to stop the mass destruction and redemption caused by those creatures. Still, if the number is small, humans with such advanced weaponry may be able to kill them or put them under control. It might sound hilarious, but who knows, we&#8217;ll have taken pictures of them in a few years, made TikTok, and visited them in zoos, right?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What if Dinosaurs return to Earth?
