It is a process that occurs in the brain and helps us prepare for sleep by storing memories from previous experiences. Dreams are not necessarily conscious thoughts; they may be random images without any specific meaning. Dreaming is normal and healthy, but it can cause problems when it disrupts waking life or interferes with daily functions like school or work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans naturally experience dreams. All of us are born with the capacity to dream and to experience lucid dreams, in which we are conscious of our&nbsp;surroundings.&nbsp;When you are conscious of your dream state and have some degree of control over it, you are said to be lucid dreaming. A dream can be a dream of our own creation, or it can be something we see in someone else&#8217;s dream. We often have no control over what happens in our dreams, but we have a lot more control over what happens in our daydreams when we&#8217;re awake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people are unaware of the extent to which their dreams affect their lives, despite the fact that sometimes dreams can be frightening or scary. You never know; they might even assist you in making crucial choices for the future!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do we dream, though?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As REM sleep and sleep patterns have been linked, it is possible for sleep deprivation or an increase in REM sleep to cause dreams .When someone awakens from REM sleep, they occasionally experience nightmares known as hypnagogic hallucinations or hypnopompic hallucinations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same subject always appears in the dreams. On that hilltop, you are observing the city below. You suddenly feel the need to return. The dream is different the next time you see it. It has a unique quality, but you are unable to identify what it is. Then, one day, you wake up and realize that it wasn&#8217;t a dream after all. Real life exists. And that&#8217;s how it always goes down: like some weird clockwork spring that gets wound tighter and tighter until it finally snaps and all of a sudden everything comes rushing forward into sight in a blinding flash of realization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ancient Greece, Socrates said &#8220;All of the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.&#8221; You can&#8217;t hold on to memories, for example, without letting go of them at the same time. A lot of people forget to dream. We view that as absurd. Dreaming is a very pleasant activity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dreaming is a natural part of sleep.
