<p>Dreaming is a natural part of sleep. It is a process that occurs in the brain and helps us prepare for sleep by storing memories from previous experiences. Dreams are not necessarily conscious thoughts; they may be random images without any specific meaning. Dreaming is normal and healthy, but it can cause problems when it disrupts waking life or interferes with daily functions like school or work.</p>



<p>Humans naturally experience dreams. All of us are born with the capacity to dream and to experience lucid dreams, in which we are conscious of our&nbsp;surroundings.&nbsp;When you are conscious of your dream state and have some degree of control over it, you are said to be lucid dreaming. A dream can be a dream of our own creation, or it can be something we see in someone else&#8217;s dream. We often have no control over what happens in our dreams, but we have a lot more control over what happens in our daydreams when we&#8217;re awake.</p>



<p>Most people are unaware of the extent to which their dreams affect their lives, despite the fact that sometimes dreams can be frightening or scary. You never know; they might even assist you in making crucial choices for the future!</p>



<p>Why do we dream, though?</p>



<p>As REM sleep and sleep patterns have been linked, it is possible for sleep deprivation or an increase in REM sleep to cause dreams .When someone awakens from REM sleep, they occasionally experience nightmares known as hypnagogic hallucinations or hypnopompic hallucinations.</p>



<p>The same subject always appears in the dreams. On that hilltop, you are observing the city below. You suddenly feel the need to return. The dream is different the next time you see it. It has a unique quality, but you are unable to identify what it is. Then, one day, you wake up and realize that it wasn&#8217;t a dream after all. Real life exists. And that&#8217;s how it always goes down: like some weird clockwork spring that gets wound tighter and tighter until it finally snaps and all of a sudden everything comes rushing forward into sight in a blinding flash of realization.</p>



<p>In Ancient Greece, Socrates said &#8220;All of the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.&#8221; You can&#8217;t hold on to memories, for example, without letting go of them at the same time. A lot of people forget to dream. We view that as absurd. Dreaming is a very pleasant activity.</p>

<p>Kaliyuga is the age in which we dwell and is the least auspicious period of the four yugas. There are specifically 432,000 years in Kaliyuga. Kaliyuga is defined by religious and moral deterioration. Humans worship false god/s, and people practice religious rites for worldly pleasures. They don&#8217;t practice their spiritual duties. Natural calamities like starvation and pestilence often occur/s. Bad people become more powerful than good ones.</p>



<p>The story goes that after a great sacrifice at the end of the Dwapara Yuga ( Krishna&#8217;s last appearance on earth), Vishnu and Brahma took a nap. A small insect woke up Vishnu and asked him to take care of him when he reawakened. When Vishnu awoke, he had forgotten about his promise, and so the insect appeared in front of him as Kali, who was a demon with an insatiable thirst for blood.</p>


<p class="has-text-align-left" style="text-align: left;">In the Kaliyuga, everything is hued in the following range: Black skin, black hair, a body odor resembling that of a donkey, and people who don&#8217;t mind the scent of their clothes and homes. The primary food is bread, and clothing is made of cotton and deer. The river water is used to make the water for drinking. Kali Yuga residents have a limited lifespan( about 100 years only).&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ultimate age of creation, the Kaliyuga, sees a steady decline in human values. Human minds are brittle and heavily influenced by the senses. People frequently act unreasonably. Most people act impulsively because the intellect is brittle and sensations are intense. The material world&#8217;s influence has weakened the mind while strengthening the senses.</p>

<p>What if Dinosaurs return to Earth?</p>



<p>Every illogical and inventive concept or thinking has a lesson to be learned from it, such as prophecies of events that cannot possibly occur; if they did, how would people respond to them?</p>



<p>Yesterday, I had some time to myself and daydreamed about impossibly impossible scenarios. What if I was never born, for instance? What if humans were like the monkeys, and they led lives similar to ours while we led lives similar to theirs? I wondered what would happen if dinosaurs made a comeback to Earth as I went through these creative, lol, not brilliant, but humorous and irrational thoughts.</p>



<p>The word &#8220;return&#8221; seems irrational; therefore, I altered the sentence to &#8220;had never departed,&#8221; that is, let&#8217;s imagine some dinosaur breeds were still alive on Earth somewhere away, hiding from humanity in a spot that is yet untraced. Let&#8217;s make the assumptions that are likely to occur based on the articles, books, movies, and studies since we weren&#8217;t present to observe what kind of weather and habitat the dinosaurs used to live in.</p>



<p>There are no locations that cannot support the survival of dinosaurs after considering all of these sources. Dinosaurs came in many different breeds. They were present practically everywhere during the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods; some species could survive in hot desert plains, while others could survive in mountains, swamps, forests, coastal islands, and a variety of other habitats. Since they would have been present practically everywhere on Earth if they were still here with us, it makes sense that our belief that they &#8220;had never left&#8221; is incorrect.It becomes sense to suppose that if these creatures, which were deadly predators with exceptional hunting intelligence, were still alive today, humanity would not have evolved. That vicious predatory race would have taken control of the entire world, and we would have been nothing more than their meals. The number of humans is growing by such a vast proportion every day, comparable to how many dinosaurs would have multiplied.&nbsp;All other species would have been wiped out and starved to death by carnivorous dinosaurs.Some of them would have evolved into herbivores and ceased consuming flesh after going for long stretches without food, while others would have consumed other dinosaurs.If dinosaurs started devouring dinosaurs, what type of cannibalism would our great Earth have witnessed? We may expect the civil war among the dinosaurs to get worse.</p>



<p>However, in this day and age, where people fight and kill one another, show prejudice toward one another, and regrettably advocate cannibalism, we must infer that dinosaurs have never departed the Earth and have instead regenerated as humans.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s go back to business. Assume a miraculous and unexpected event occurs, and dinosaurs appear out of nowhere. See, there are two possibilities here: what if the number of dinosaurs that have come is small or enormous? If the number is enormous, we humans will be powerless to stop the mass destruction and redemption caused by those creatures. Still, if the number is small, humans with such advanced weaponry may be able to kill them or put them under control. It might sound hilarious, but who knows, we&#8217;ll have taken pictures of them in a few years, made TikTok, and visited them in zoos, right?</p>
